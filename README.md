# U2Q (Auto Queue)
- ("Uto-uto ko") hahahaha im so funny yep! - (U2Q = Auto Queue)

- U2Q (short for Auto Queue) is a lightweight, modern full-stack MVP designed to **demonstrate reliable CRM integration and automated lead management** using React, Express.js, and a PostgreSQL database (Supabase).

## About the Project
- This project was built as a showcase for integrating front-end form submissions, a Node/Express API, and automated CRM actions — all with zero fluff.

- U2Q's primary function is to **capture leads, store them reliably in Postgres**, and **instantly synchronize** them to services like Zoho CRM.

- This project uses **n8n**, an open-source workflow automation tool, to connect our API with external services, handling repetitive tasks like **sending confirmation emails and triggering CRM syncing** through visual, no-code workflows. It's designed to simplify processes while remaining fully customizable.
